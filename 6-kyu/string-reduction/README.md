<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/59fab1f0c9fc0e7cd4000072/train/javascript target="_blank">String reduction</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>In this Kata, we are going to see how a Hash (or Map or dict) can be used to keep track of characters in a string. </p><p>Consider two strings <code>"aabcdefg"</code> and <code>"fbd"</code>. How many characters do we have to remove from the first string to get the second string?  Although not the only way to solve this, we could create a Hash of counts for each string and see which character counts are different. That should get us close to the answer. I will leave the rest to you. </p><p>For this example, <code>solve("aabcdefg","fbd") = 5</code>. Also, <code>solve("xyz","yxxz") = 0</code>, because we cannot get second string from the first since the second string is longer.</p><p>More examples in the test cases.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
