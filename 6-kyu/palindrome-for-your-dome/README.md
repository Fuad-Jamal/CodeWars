Famous examples include "Amore, Roma", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and "No 'x' in 'Nixon'". - wikipedia</p><p>Our goal is to determine whether or not a given string is a valid palindrome or not.</p><p>Like the above examples, here are a few test cases which are also populated: </p><pre><code>"Amore, Roma" =&gt; valid"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" =&gt; valid"No 'x' in 'Nixon'" =&gt; valid"Abba Zabba, you're my only friend" =&gt; invalid</code></pre><p>You can see that they are case insensitive and disregards non alphanumeric characters. In addition to a few predefined tests, your function will also be tested against a random string generator 50 times.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p><p>The empty string <code>""</code> can be read forward or backward the same, it's a palindrome in our case.</p>
