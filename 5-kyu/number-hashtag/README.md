Your job is to extract those keywords so that they can be used later on for whatever purposes. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> </p><ul><li>Pound signs alone do not count, for example: the string "#" would return an empty array.</li><li>If a word is preceded by more than one hashtag, only the last hashtag counts (e.g. "##alot" would return ["alot"])</li><li>Hashtags cannot be within the middle of a word (e.g. "in#line hashtag" returns an empty array)</li><li>Hashtags must precede alphabetical characters (e.g. "#120398" or "#?" are invalid)</li></ul><p><strong>Input:</strong> String of words, where some words may contain a hashtag.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Array of strings that were prefixed with the hashtag, but do not contain the hashtag.</p>
